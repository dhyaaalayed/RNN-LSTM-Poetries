# Overview:
We implemented a generative model to generate poetries. This model has been trained on multim_poem.json file [has been taken from microsoft project]. Some of the generated poems:

-...

# Methods used
Methods used in this project belong to two AI branches, Natural Language Processing to vectorize the training data and Machine Learning particulatly Deep Learning, because we need a Recurrent Neural Network as generative model.

# Prepaire our training data:
As we mensioned we have a sequqcne of 3 words as input to predict the next one. We prepaied the training data as follows:
[X_data], [Y_data]
